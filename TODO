- Make the possibility of changing color / screen in blackboard mode using the mouse too. (detection of the mouse part).

- ? Some gesture for changing the drawing line size.

- Fine adjustment of right, left, down swipe gestures (improved but need better performance yet).

- Make a new mode: "input", in which movements detected in the Leap Motion are
  mapped to keyboard, mouse actions (instead of showing a blackboard). For use
  in any other applications. Note that "input" is a beta name yet.

- Make a principal Swing interface to change between blackboard and "input" mode.

- Make the LeapMotionListener implements the "observer" pattern (for using the same
  code for blackboard / "input" mode).
  
- New gesture in blackboard mode: up swipe, for showing miniaturized screens.
