- Fine adjustment of right, left, down swipe gestures (at the moment, it works using
  pitch, roll angles of the vector, and it seems to work but with some problems).

- Relativize "absolute pixels" in Constants.Blackboard.

- Make the possibility of changing color / screen in blackboard mode using the mouse too.

- ? Some gesture for changing the drawing line size.

- Improve the "SAVED!" text, for visibility.

- Make a new mode: "input", in which movements detected in the Leap Motion are
  mapped to keyboard, mouse actions (instead of showing a blackboard). For use
  in any other applications. Note that "input" is a beta name yet.

- Make a principal Swing interface to change between blackboard and "input" mode.

- Make the LeapMotionListener implements the "observer" pattern (for using the same
  code for blackboard / "input" mode).
  
- New gesture in blackboard mode: up swipe, for closing this mode and returning to the
  principal Swing window (asking the user with a window that permits gestures or mouse actions).
