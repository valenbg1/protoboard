- Change detection of circle gesture: instead of detecting a "discrete" gestures, detect a circle gesture
  every time the user makes a complete circle.

- Use screen tap instead of down swipe to select screen in multiscreen mode.

- ? Better borders for screens in multiscreen mode.

- Make the possibility of using protoboard without Leap Motion lib installed.

- ? Some gesture for changing the drawing line size.

- Fine adjustment of right, left, down swipe gestures (improved but need better performance yet).

- Make a new mode: "input", in which movements detected in the Leap Motion are
  mapped to keyboard, mouse actions (instead of showing a blackboard). For use
  in any other applications. Note that "input" is a beta name yet.

- Make a principal Swing interface to change between blackboard and "input" mode.
