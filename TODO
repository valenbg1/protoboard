* Make a color wheel instead of the actual color square in blackboard mode.

* Make a erase color!

* Nice transitions in multiscreen mode.

* Check and make the possibility of using protoboard without Leap Motion lib installed.

* Fine adjustment of right, left, down swipe gestures (improved but need better performance yet).

* Make a new mode: "input", in which movements detected in the Leap Motion are
  mapped to keyboard, mouse actions (instead of showing a blackboard). For use
  in any other applications. Note that "input" is a beta name yet.

* Make a principal Swing interface to change between blackboard and "input" mode.

* ? Better borders for screens in multiscreen mode.

* ? Some gesture for changing the drawing line size.
